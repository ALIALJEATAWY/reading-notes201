# HTML

## Links


* ***Links are the defining feature of the webbecause they allow you to move fromone web page to another — enabling thevery idea of browsing or surfing.***

* ***Links are created using the < - a -> element Users can click on anythingbetween the opening < - a - > tag and the closing < -/a -> tag. You specify which page you want to link to using the href attribute.***


*On larger websites it's a good idea to organize your code by placing the pages for each different section of the site into a new folder. Folders on awebsite are sometimes referred to as directories.*


### Relative URLs

* Relative URLs can be used when linking to pages within your own website. They provide a shorthand way of telling the browser where to find your files.



## Layout

* If one block-level element sits inside another block-level element then the outer box is known as the containing or parent element.


* ***CSS has the following positioning schemes that allow you to control the layout of a page: normal flow, relative positioning, and absolute positioning. You specify the positioning scheme using the position property in CSS. You can also float elements using the float property.***


- *< div > elements are often used as containing elements to group together sections of a page.*



### Screen Sizes

*Different visitors to your site will have different sized screens that show different amounts of information, so your design needs to be able to work on a range of different sized screens*


### Layout Grids

- ***Composition in any visual art (such as design, painting, or photography) is the placement or arrangement of visual elements — how they are organized on a page. Many designers use a grid structure to help them position items on a page, and the same is true for web designers.***


### CSS Frameworks

- ***CSS frameworks aim to make your life easier by providing the code for common tasks, such as creating layout grids, styling forms, creating printer-friendly versions of pages and so on. You can include the CSS framework code in your projects rather than writing the CSS from scratch.***


* You can include multiple CSS files in one page.

### Functions methods & objects

***Browsers require very detailed instructions about what we want them to do. Therefore, complex scripts can run to hundreds (even thousands) of lines. Programmers use functions, methods, and objects to organize their code. This chapter is divided into three sections that introduce:***

* FUNCTIONS & METHODS
* OBJECTS 
* BUILT-In OBJECTS


* Global variables use more memory. The browser has to remember them for as long as the web page using them is loaded. Local variables are only remembered during the period of time that a function is being executed. 


## pair porogram

* Iterative loops. Code reviews. Fast feedback. Error checking and linting. These are software engineering practices that have proven to dramatically improve the quality of code developers produce. 


* there are many different styles, pair programming commonly involves two roles: 
* the Driver and the Navigator.
* The Driver is the programmer.


* there is Reasons for Pair Programming:


- Greater efficiency.
- Engaged collaboration.
- Learning from fellow students.
- Social skills.
- Job interview readiness.
- Work environment readiness.
