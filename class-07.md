## Tables

***There are several types of information that need to be displayed in a grid or table. For example: sports results, stock reports, train timetables.***

* *A table represents information in a grid format. Examples of tables include financial reports, TV schedules, and sports results.*

Sometimes you may need the entries in a table to stretch across more than one column.

**There are three elements that help distinguish between the main content of the table and the first and last rows (which can contain different content).**

* For long tables you can split the table into a < thead > ,   < tbody >, and < tfoot >.

## Object



 * Once you have created an object(using literal or constructornotation), you can add new properties to it.


* ***The keyword this is commonly used inside functions and objects. Where the function is declared alters what this means. It always refers to one object, usually the object in which the function operates.***



In JavaScript, data is represented using name/value pairs. To organize your data, you can use an array or object to group a set of related values. In arrays and objects the name is also known as a key.


* ***If you want to access items via a property name or key, use an object (but note that each key in the object must be unique). If the order of the items is important, use an array.***




### GLOBAL OBJECTS:
   NUMBER OBJECT

Whenever you have a value that is a number, you can use the methods and properties of the Number object on it.


In an object, variables are known as properties of the
object; functions are known as methods of the object.


Arrays and objects can be used to create complex data sets (and both can contain the other).
