## Layout

* If one block-level element sits inside another block-level element then the outer box is known as the containing or parent element.


* ***CSS has the following positioning schemes that allow you to control the layout of a page: normal flow, relative positioning, and absolute positioning. You specify the positioning scheme using the position property in CSS. You can also float elements using the float property.***


- *< div > elements are often used as containing elements to group together sections of a page.*



### Screen Sizes

*Different visitors to your site will have different sized screens that show different amounts of information, so your design needs to be able to work on a range of different sized screens*


### Layout Grids

- ***Composition in any visual art (such as design, painting, or photography) is the placement or arrangement of visual elements â€” how they are organized on a page. Many designers use a grid structure to help them position items on a page, and the same is true for web designers.***


* If a containing element only contains floated elements, some browsers will treat it as if it is zero pixels tall.


***Because screen sizes and display resolutions vary so much, web designers often try to create pages of around 960-1000 pixels wide (since most users will be able to see designs this wide on their screens).***


Fixed width layout designs do not change size as the user increases or decreases the size of their browser window. Measurements tend to be given in pixels.



* Grids help create professional and flexible designs.
