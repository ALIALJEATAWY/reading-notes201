## HTML

### Structure
*In all kinds of documents, structure is very important in helping readers to understand the messages you are trying to convey and to navigate around the document.*

* *Tags act like containers. They tell you something about the information that lies between their opening and closing tags.*

* *Attributes provide additional information about the contents of an element. They appear on the opening tag of the element and are made up of two parts: a name and a value, separated by an equals sign.*

- *The majority of attributes can only be used on certain elements, although a few attributes*
- *Most attribute values are either pre-deﬁned or follow a stipulated format. We will look at the permitted values as we introduce each new attribute.*
- *The value of the lang attribute is an abbreviated way of specifying which language is used inside the element that all browsers understand.*

### Extra Markup

***Since the web was first created, there have been several different versions of HTML:***
* *HTML 4 (Re leased 1997)*
* *XHTML 1.0 (Re leased 2000)*
* *HTML5 (Re leased 2000)*

#### DOCTYPES
***Because there have been several versions of HTML, each web page should begin with a DOCTYPE declaration to tell a browser which version of HTML the page is using (although browsers usually display the page even if it is not included).***

* #### Comments in HTML 
***If you want to add a comment to your code that will not be visible in the user's browser***

* #### ID Attribute 
***Every HTML element can carry the id attribute. It is used to uniquely identify that element from other elements on the page. Its value should start with a letter or an underscore (not a number or any other character).***

*The id and class attributes allow you to identify particular elements.*

* *< iframes > cut windows into your web pages through which other pages can be displayed.*

* *The <meta> tag allows you to supply all kinds of information about your web page.*

### HTML5

***HTML5 introduces a new set of elements that allow you to divide up the parts of a page. The names of these elements indicate the kind of content you will find in them. They are still subject to change, but that has not stopped many web page authors using them already.***


* *Older browsers that do not understand HTML5 elements need to be told which elements are block-level elements.*


### Process & Design

***Every website should be designed for the target audience—not just for yourself or the site owner. It is therefore very important to understand who your target audience is.***


#### WireFrames
***A wireframe is a simple sketch of the key information that needs to go on each page of a site. It shows the hierarchy of the information and how much space it might require.***


* *You can differentiate between pieces of information using size, color, and style.*


* *You can use grouping and similarity to help simplify the information you present.*

## JAVASCRIPT
***Javascript allows you to make web pages more interactive by accessing and modifying the content***

* *ACCESS CONTENT*
* *MODIFY CONTENT*
* *PROGRAM RULES*
* *REACT TO EVENTS*

***A script is a series of instructions that a computer can follow to achieve a goal.***


* ***Every step for every task shown in a flowchart needs to be written in a language the computer can understand and follow.***


* *In the real world, people interact with objects. These interactions can change the values of the properties in these objects.*


* *Methods represent things people need to do with objects. They can retrieve or update the values of an object's properties.*



* ***When you want to use JavaScript with a web page, you use the HTML< script > element to tell the browser it is coming across a script. Its s re attribute tells people where the JavaScript file is stored.***
