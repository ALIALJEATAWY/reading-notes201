# JavaScript

## Object

***Objects group together a set of variables and functions to create a model of a something you would recognize from the real world. In an object, variables and functions take on new names.***



* **The keyword this is commonly used inside functions and objects. Where the function is declared alters what this means. It always refers to one object, usually the object in which the function operates.**




## Document object model

**The Document Object Model (DOM) specifies how browsers should create a model of an HTML page and how JavaScript can access and update the contents of a web page while it is in the browser window.**



* THE DOM TREE IS A MODEL OF A WEB PAGE
*As a browser loads a web page, it creates a model of that page. The model is called a DOM tree, and it is stored in the browsers' memory. It consists of four main types of nodes.*



* *Accessing and updating the DOM tree involves two steps:*

1: Locate the node that represents the element you want to work with.
2: Use its text content, child elements, and attributes. 



***ACCESSING ELEMENTS***

***DOM queries may return one element, or they may return a Nodelist, which is a collection of nodes.***


* When a DOM method can return more than one element, it returns a Nodelist (even if it only finds one matching element). 


When you have an element node, you can select another element in relation to it using these five properties. This is known as traversing the DOM. 


* Traversing the DOM can be difficult because some browsers add a text node whenever they come across whitespace between elements. 

- The textContent property allows you to collect or update just the text that is in the containing element (and its children). 

Using the i nnerHTML property, you can access and amend the contents of an element, including any child elements. 

innerHTML
When getting HTML from an element, the i nnerHTML property will get the content of an element and return it as one long string, including any markup that the element contains. 


DOM manipulation offers another technique to add new content to a page (rather than i nnerHTML). It involves three steps: 

* CREATE THE ELEMENT (createEl ement () )
* GIVE IT CONTENT (createTextNode() )
* ADD IT TO THE DOM( appendChild() )




* DOM manipulation can be used to remove elements from the DOM tree. 

- STORE THE ELEMENT TO BE REMOVED IN A VARIABLE
- STORE THE PARENT OF THAT ELEMENT IN A VARIABLE 
- REMOVE THE ELEMENT FROM ITS CONTA INING ELEMENT


***If you add HTML to a page using i nnerHTML (or several jQuery methods), you need to be aware of Cross-Site Scripting Attacks or XSS; otherwise, an attacker could gain access to your users' accounts.***




* Any content generated by users that contain characters that are used in code should be escaped on the server. You must control any markup added to the page. 


* ***Modern browsers come with tools that help you inspect the page loaded in the browser and understand the structure of the DOM tree.***


*In older browsers, implementation of the DOM is inconsistent (and is a popular reason for using jQuery).*
