### IMAGES

***picture can say a thousand words, and great images help make the difference between an average-looking site and a really engaging one.***

* Images can be used to set the tone for a site in less time than it takes to read a description.

#### Storing Images on your Site

If you are building a site from scratch, it is good practice to create a folder for all of the images the site uses.

* *To add an image into the page you need to use an < img > element*

* *You will also often see an < img > element use two other attributes that specify its size:*
- Height
- width


***There are three rules to remember when you are creating images for your website which are summarized below:***
- Save images in the right format.
- Save images at the right size.
- Use the correct resolution.

* The images you use on your website should be saved at the same width and height that you want them to appear on the page.



*Images created for the web should be saved at a resolution of 72 ppi. The higher the resolution of the image, the larger the size of the file.*



### Animated GIFs

***Animated GIFs show several frames of an image in sequence and therefore can be used to create simple animations.***



## Color

* ***The color property allows you to specify the color of text inside an element. You can specify any color in CSS in one of three ways:***

- rgb values:These express colors in terms of how much red, green and blue are used to make it up.

-  hex codes: These are six-digit codes that represent the amount of red, green and blue in a color, preceded by a pound or hash # sign. 

- color names: There are 147 predefined color names that are recognized
by browsers.


* Every color on a computer screen is created by mixing amounts of red, green, and blue. To find the color you want, you can use a color picker.


* CSS3 also allows you to specify colors as HSL values, with an optional opacity value. It is known as HSLA.



## Text

When choosing a typeface, it is important to understand that a browser will usually only display it if it's installed on that user's computer.


* *There are several ways to use fonts other than those listed on the previous page. However, typefaces are subject to copyright, so the techniques you can choose from are limited by their respective licenses.*

You may have noticed that programs such as Word, Photoshop and InDesign offer the same sizes of text.


The vertical-align property is a common source of confusion. It is not intended to allow you to vertically align text in the middle of block level elements such as < p > and < div >, although it does have this effect when used with table cells (the < td > and < th > elements).



* ***There are three pseudo-classes that allow you to change the appearance of elements when a user is interacting with them:***

- hover:
This is applied when a user hovers over an element with a pointing device such as a mouse. 

- active:
This is applied when an element is being activated by a user.

- focus:
This is applied when an element has focus.



* You can use pseudo-classes to change the style of an element when a user hovers over or clicks on text, or when they have visited a link.
